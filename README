# XSM simulator for eXpl

This repository contains the implementation of a compiler for the ExpL language, following the roadmap outlined on the [SILC NITC ExpL Documentation](https://silcnitc.github.io/expl-docs/roadmap/) website.

## Project Overview

The ExpL compiler is developed in stages, each building upon the previous one to create a fully functional compiler for the ExpL language. This project assumes background knowledge in C programming, Data Structures, and Principles of Computer Organization.

## ExpL Grammar Visualization

Below is a rough Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) representation of the ExpL language grammar:

## Roadmap

The compiler development is divided into the following stages:

1. **Installation**: Setting up the necessary environment and tools.

2. **Code Generation for Arithmetic Expressions**: Implementing basic arithmetic operations.

3. **Introduction to Static Storage Allocation**: Managing memory for static variables.

4. **Adding Flow Control Statements**: Implementing conditional statements and loops.

5. **User Defined Variables and Arrays**: Supporting custom variables and array data structures.

6. **Adding Functions**: Implementing function calls and definitions.

7. **User Defined Types and Dynamic Memory Allocation**: Supporting custom data types and dynamic memory management.

8. **Adding Objects â€“ Data Encapsulation**: Implementing object-oriented programming concepts.

9. **Inheritance and Sub-type Polymorphism**: Adding support for inheritance and polymorphism.
